# Guide   

This is a guide to setting up a reverse shell and Gaining Persistance in the environment.

## Senario

You will create a payload that will be ran on the blue team training environment 45 minutes after the blue team powers on and starts hardening their network. Your goal will be to stealthly persist as many systems as possilble day one. Day two if you have any persistance you will start to do things to alert the blue team of your presence. EX: Change background, delete firewall rules and remove files.

### Hints   

Linux 64x   
firewall is up but systems require 80,443,53 outbound
